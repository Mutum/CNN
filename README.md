# CNN Project

### CNN exploration
- Exploration of fundamental building blocks of CNN
- https://github.com/Mutum/CNN/blob/master/CNN_exploration.ipynb

### Test your CNN skills
- Achieving 95+ accuracy on MNIST data set is common pattern with huge parameters and long layers
- Here, challenge is to achieve 99+ accuracy with epoch lesser than 10 and trainable parameter less than 20K

### Densenet 
- Build Densenet architecture from scratch
